titulo: Free the future
subtitulo: Our movement

p1Movimento: Many people say the world won’t be the same after the pandemic caused by the new coronavirus. It won’t be. But it might be even worse.
p2Movimento: Today, more material wealth lies in the hands of only 2,153 billionaires than in the hands of 60% of the planet’s other 7,790,000,000 human inhabitants. These billionaires represent such an insignificant fraction of the global population that they become invisible when their number is expressed in a percentage. Yet the inequality they produce is brutally visible.
p3Movimento: We want a world for the 99.99%.
p4Movimento: We cannot accept the return of a normalcy that despoils nature and condemns billions to poverty and bodily exhaustion. We cannot permit the continued destruction of the Amazon, ever closer to the tipping point. We must use the current suspension of economic activities to go back to imagining a future where we can live and where we want to. We are experiencing physical isolation, not social isolation. Ideas need to circulate. When we imagine the future, we begin to create it.
p5Movimento: Why have we launched this movement? Because we want a world for human beings and future generations—and for all the non-human beings who inhabit the Earth. We must join forces around this urgent need. If we don’t act, we will be left with nothing but a hostile future on a planet devoured by capitalism and by a climate crisis provoked by a mode of production incompatible with life. The destruction of nature—the nature from which most humans have tragically cut themselves off—will ignite more pandemics and is already overheating the planet. We have launched this movement because we don’t want to be slaughtered like cattle. Whether in rural areas or in cities, we want to live like the forest—standing tall—and we want to fight.

subtituloFunciona: How it works
p1Funciona: Inspired by the thinkers Ailton Krenak, Achille Mbembe, Bruno Latour, Eliane Brum, Grada Kilomba, and Paul Preciado, we invite you to come up with five proposals for postponing the end of the world and imagining possibilities for our post-pandemic future. We believe questions are as important as answers. To help with this exercise of the imagination, we are offering five suggestions of our own. These are meant to prompt you to devise your own questions and then reply to them. 
p2Funciona: These proposals should be recorded on a one-minute video, filmed horizontally. At the beginning of the video, state your name and the city and country you live in. Post your video to social media with the hashtag #FreeTheFuture or send it in via WhatsApp +55 (11) 975579830. All videos will be collected on an open digital platform. The material will not belong to any one individual, but to all of us collectively. You can share it, analyze it, and act.
p3Funciona: We realize it can be hard to ask ourselves what we want and expose our thoughts to the world. It is indeed hard to try to change the world. But when you start, you’ll realize the very act of imagining—alone or with your group of friends, community, collective, organization, or business—is already changing you. The act of imagining is a powerful force.
p4Funciona: If you don’t want to start with the proposed topics, ask yourself just one question
p4FuncionaEnfase: What future do you want to free?
p4FuncionaContinua: Do not give up. To give up fighting for the future, at this historical moment, may mean giving up on the present.
p5FuncionaQuote: The future is here and now, there may not be next year
p5Funciona: says Ailton Krenak.


frase1: against the end of the world, imagine how you want to live. (dare! dream, create, extrapolate reason.);
frase2: propose public policies and legislative and normative changes that will reduce racial, gender, and class inequalities and take democracy beyond the mere act of voting every election. (Dare! And be objective.);
frase3: suggest ways of eliminating the consumption habits that enslave our species and others as well. (Dare! And be specific.);
frase4: suggest actions to stop the destruction of nature and guarantee the continuity of all forms of life on the planet. (Dare! And be a fighter.);
frase5: define the best form of civil disobedience for creating the future in which you want to live! (Dare!).

tituloQuemSomos: Who we are
subtituloQuemSomos: Everyone who makes this movement happen
p1QuemSomos: We are the 99.99%. We are a movement to free the future. And in movement we grow every day. There is no authorship, there is no one capturing anything. We invite everyone to contribute with a critical, dynamic reflection on the post-pandemic moment and another possible world. Within this network, we are river and street, imagination and reality; we are human beings and more than human beings. The way the world spun before the coronavirus crisis was a catastrophe foretold. We face one of our last chances to change the course now pushing us quickly to the cliff, a course that has already ushered in the age of pandemics.
p2QuemSomos: We believe it is important to register our presence and our imagination. This will help comprehend who we are and what we want. It also drives the creation of a living document for future generations and a source of research to understand this actual moment, in which Earth is on the edge. We’ve created an anti-form below, with questions that will allow getting to know you better, and by getting to know you, we’ll be able to get to know more about the world we live in. If you want to join this movement with us, fill in the anti-form below as you wish - entirely or just a few sections.
